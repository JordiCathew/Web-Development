## Important note before starting

This implementation is pure Front-end app built with React to practice concepts. 

## Requirements

* Node.js
* npm (Node Package Manager)

Once you have these installed, it's time to install React using npm (you can simply do npm install and all of the dependencies will be installed):

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the development server to run the app locally.

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
